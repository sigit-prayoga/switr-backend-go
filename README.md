### Navigate to the project root folder

```sh
$ cd [projectRoot]
```

### Run GO (with assumption you've already installed GO and set GOPATH). [See GO installation here](https://golang.org/doc/install) 
```sh
$ go run main.go
```
> *I should quit and rerun whenever create changes in a code.*
>> **In this case, you might need [gin, the autoreload](https://github.com/codegangsta/gin)**

### To install gin
```sh
$ go get github.com/codegangsta/gin
```

### Run Gin in your project root
```sh
$ gin
```

> Use ```-i``` flag to immediately run after build succeed
